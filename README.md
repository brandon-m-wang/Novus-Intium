Inspiration
With student debt in the United States skyrocketing while pay stays roughly stagnant, not everyone can afford to go to a four-year institution. For these people, reaching their career goals might not seem possible, and they might stick to working passionless jobs for their whole lives. We wanted to come up with an application that would allow for people who are not happy with their current careers to work towards rewarding careers

What it does
Our web application lets users make an account to manage their career paths. Initially, it prompts users to input answers to various questions accessing their current qualifications as well as their dream jobs. Afterwards, it generates a resume for the user based on where they currently are, and it generates a future resume with qualifications that they should work towards getting to get their dream job. The "future resume" has links and resources that the users can use to work towards each individual qualification.

How we built it
We used react to build out the front-end, and we used Google Cloud firebase as the basis for back-end. On firebase, we used a Realtime Database to store our user information and job qualification information.

Challenges we ran into
During the project, we ran into a few problems with properly connecting our front and back end.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we managed to completely build out a web react app!

What we learned
We learned how to use react for web applications and Google Cloud's firebase.

What's next for Novus
The next step for Novus would be to add in more career paths for users to choose from. Currently, we have a few tracks stored in the Google Cloud real-time database, but having more variety in careers would enable for everyone to find their dream career on our website.
